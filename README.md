A simple command line tool for comparing the similarity between two images. Works on PNGs and JPGs. Responds with a weighted percentage of the differences between the images, and/or generates a new image highlighting the differences between the two inputs.

**Full credit for the image diff'ing functionality of this goes to [Jimp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jimp) and related authors. This is effectively a CLI interface around it with some more customized options.**

## Installation

    $ npm install -g image-diffr


## CLI Usage

    image-diffr ./path/to/1.png ./path/to/2.png


### CLI Options

  - Threshold `-t [value], --threshold [value]`

    How stringent should the comparison be (from 0 to 1: 0 being perfect match, 1 being pretty damn lack路a路dai路si路cal).

        image-diffr ./path/to/1.png ./path/to/2.png -t 0.25
    
  - Output `-o [path], --output [path]`

    Output an image highlighting the differences between the two input images. The file extension you specify in the name of the output file (.jpg below) should match the input file types.

        image-diffr ./path/to/1.png ./path/to/2.png -o /tmp/diff.jpg
  
  - Quit `-q, --quiet`

    By default, image-diffr will show a few stats (see image above) when run. To silence that business, pass `-q` or `--quiet` and it'll become this:

    ![Alt text](./docs/cli-quiet.png?raw=true "Quit CLI output")
  
  - Help

    Invoke without any arguments

        $: image-diffr

        Options:

        -h, --help                   output usage information
        -V, --version                output the version number
        -t, --threshold [threshold]  Diff comparison threshold (0-1, eg. 0.25)
        -o, --output [output]        Image diff output (absolute path, eg. /tmp/diff-image.jpg)
        -q, --quiet [quiet]          Skip detailed output and show diff percentage only


## Running tests

    npm test
